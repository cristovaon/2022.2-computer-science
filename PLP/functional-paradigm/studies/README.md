## Haskell

### Haskell is a purely functional language with referential transparency

- In computer science, referential transparency and referential opacity are properties of parts of computer programs. An expression is called referentially transparent if it can be replaced with its corresponding value without changing the program's behavior.

### Haskell uses Type inference

- Type inference refers to the automatic detection of the type of an expression in a formal language.

### More characteristics

- The values are immutable
- Functions are first-class values: Can be passed as a parameter to other functions
- Recursion is used very often
- Haskell is lazy
- Haskell is statically typed
